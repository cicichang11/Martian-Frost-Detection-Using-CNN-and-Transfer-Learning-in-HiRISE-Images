# Martian-Frost-Detection-Using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning-in-HiRISE-Images
This project applies CNN and transfer learning techniques to identify frost in Martian images using the HiRISE dataset. It includes data pre-processing, training of a CNN combined with an MLP, and the use of pre-trained models (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and VGG16) in a transfer learning approach.
